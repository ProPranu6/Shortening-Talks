I want to measure in that back. Really want to put together? And how do I decide relative waste weight? So John and Anna and I could have made our Arch or this time?  Try wrong terms on our job.  This term really easy if we had sat down at the beginning of the term is so you know, we talked This course many times we got data from.  I don't know Jon.  Thousands of students probably over this time.  That's just build a little learning algorithm. It takes a set of data and predicts your final grade.  You don't have to come class.  Don't have to go through all the problems that will just predict your final grade.  A little easier and you may or may not like that idea well.  I could think about predicting that crate now.  Why am I telling you this example?  I was trying to see if I could get a few.  Smiles, I saw a couple of them there. But think about the features. What would I measure? I shall put this on, John. Cuz It's his idea. What would he measure? Well, Gpas. Probably not a bad predictor performance.  You do well in other classes.  You're likely to do well in this class.  I'm going to use this one very carefully.  Prior programming experience is at least a predictor, but it is not a perfect predictor.  Those are you having program before in this class?  You can still do really well in this class, but it's an indication that you've seen other programming languages on the other hand.  I don't believe in astrology, so I don't think the month in which you're born. The aastra astrological sign under which you were born and has probably anything to do with how. Well you program.  I doubt that I color has anything to do with.  How will you program you get the idea?  Some features matter others, don't no.  I could just throw all the features in and hope that the machine learning algorithm sorts out those it wants to keep from those it doesn't, but I remind you that idea of overfitting if I do that. There is the danger that it will find some correlation between birth month. I color and GPA, and that's going to lead to a conclusion that we really don't like by the way. In case you're worried.  I can assure you that.  Stu Schmill, in the dean of Admissions Department, does not use machine learning to pick you.  He actually looks at a whole bunch of things because it's not easy to replace him with a machine.  Yeah. By so what this says is we need to think about. How do we pick the features and mostly what we're trying to do is to? Maximize something called the signal to noise ratio of maximize those features that carry the most information and remove the ones that don't so.  I want to show you an example of how you might think about this.  I want a label reptiles.  I want to come up with a way of labeling animals.  As are there a reptile or not going to give you a single example with a single example.  You can't really do much, but he, from this example I. Know that a cobra is it lays eggs. It has scales as poisonous as cold blooded has no legs and it's a reptile. So I can say my model of a reptile is well.  I'm not certain I don't have enough data yet, But if I give you a second example, and it also happens to be egg laying, have scales, poisonous, cold blooded, no legs.  There is my model right, perfectly reasonable model Whether I designed it or machine.  Learning all good would do, it says, if all of these are true label, it is a reptile. Okay, and now I give you a boa.  Constrictor, it's a reptile, but it doesn't fit the model in a particular, it's not eggling, and it's not poisonous, so I got to refine the model or the algorithms got to refine the model in this.  I want to remind you looking at the feature, so I started out with five features.  This doesn't fit so probably what I should do is reduce. It will look at Scales. I'm going to look at Cold.  Blooded I'm going to look at likes That captures all three examples and can even think about this in terms of clustering.  All three of them would fit with them okay now.  I give you another example.  I don't think it's a reptile.  I'm pretty sure it's not a reptile, and it nicely still fits this model, right because while it has scales, but you may not realize it's not cold blooded, and it has like so it is a negative example that reinforces the model. Sounds good and Ill.  Give you an alligator the! Reptile and, oh, fudge, right, It doesn't satisfy the model because well, it does have scales and it is cold blooded It has likes Im. Almost done with example, But you see the point again. I got to think about. How do I refine this and I could by saying all right, let's make a. Little more complicated, have scales, cold blooded 0 or 4 legs going to say it's a wrap top. I'll give you the dart frog. Modern reptiles. And amphibian. And that's nice because it's still satisfy, so it's an example outside of the Classic, this says, no scales, not cold blooded, but the cops have four legs is not a reptile. That's good, and then I give you a happy Python, right.  I mean, there has to be a python in here.  Pokemon at least grown at me. When I say that there has to be a python here and I'll give you that in a salmon. And now I am in trouble Because look at Scales, look at Cold.  Blooded look at likes. I can't separate them on those features. There's no way to come up with a way that will correctly say that the python is a reptile and the salmon is not it's so there's no easy to wait to add in that rule and probably my best thing is to.  Simply go back to just two features, scales and cold blooded and basically say if something has scales and it's cold blooded.  I'm going to call it a reptile. If it doesn't have both of those, I'm going to say it's not a reptile. It won't be perfect in correctly label the salmon, but I've made a design.  Choice here, this important in the design choices that I will have no false negatives. But that means there's there's not going to be any instance of something. That's not a reptile that I'm going to call a reptile.  I may have some false positives, so I did the wrong way.  False negative, says everything. That's not a reptile.  I'm going to say I'm going to categorize that direct.  I may have some false positives in that.  I may have a few things that I will incorrectly labeled as a reptile. And, in particular story, salmon is going to be an instance of that this trade off of false, positive and false negative. Just something that we worry about as we think about it, cuz there's no perfect way in many cases separated the data, And if you think back to my example of the New England Patriots that running back in that wide receiver were so close together in height and weight, There's no way I'm going to be able to separate them apart, and I just have to be willing to decide how many false, positive or false negatives Do I want to tolerate? Once I figured out what features to use, just go, then I have to decide about distance how? Do I compared to feature vectors going to save Doctor? Cuz there be multiple Dimensions to it.  How do I decide how to compare them because I want to use the distances to figure out either how to group things together or how to find a dividing line that separates things apart. So one of the things?  I have to decide is which features I also have to decide the distance and finally I'm a wanted to side house weigh relative importance of different dimensions in the feature.  Vector. Some may be more valuable than others in making that decision and want to show you an example of that lets.  Go back to my animals!  I got I started off with a feature.  Vector that actually had five Dimensions to it was egg laying cold blooded has scales. Other One was a number of legs. So one of the ways I could think about this is saying.  I've got four binary features and one integer feature associated with each animal in one way to learn to separate out reptiles, turn on reptiles has to measure the distance between pairs of examples and use that distance. Acai, what's near each other and what's not another, You said before it leads to be used to Cluster things where to find a classifier surface that separates them, so here's a simple way to do it for each of these examples.  I'm going to do select.  Ruby one false me zero. So the first four are there.  Zeros are ones in the last ones. The number of likes and now.  I can say alright.  How do I measure distances between animals or anything else? But these kinds of feature vectors here we're going to use something called them in Kowski metric or the Makowski difference, Given two vectors and a power P. We basically take the absolute value of the difference between each of the components of the vector.  Raise it to the piece power, take the sum and take the piece root of that. Let's do the two obvious examples. If P is equal to one, I just measure the absolute distance between each component.  Add them up and that's.  My distance is called The Manhattan metric. The one you see more than we saw last time. If P is equal to 2 this is this is Euclidean distance, right, It's the sum of the squares of the differences of the components. Take the square root take the square root because it makes it have certain properties of a distance. That's right, that's the euclidean distance, So now if I want to measure difference between these two, here's the question. Is this circle closer to the star or closer to the cross?  Unfortunately, put the answer up here. But it differs depending on the metric.  I use right Euclidean distance. Well, that's \u221a 2 * 2 Source about 2.8 and that's three, so in terms of just standard and distance in the plane, We would say that these two were closer than those two are Manhattan distance.  Why is it called that cuz you can only walk along the Avenue and the street's Manhattan distance would basically say this is one two three four units away. This is 123 units and under Manhattan distance.  This is closer!  This pairing is closer than that pairing is now you're used to thinking Euclidean. We're going to use that, but this is going to be important when we think about. How were we comparing distances between these different pieces so typically will use a cute euclidean. We're going to see Manhattan actually has some value, so I go back to my three examples way.  That's a gross slide, isn't it? But there we go rattle snake, boa constrictor and dart frog. There is a representation.  I can ask what's the distance between them.  Today we giving you a little piece of code that would do that. And if I actually run through it, I get actually a nice little result.  Here are the distances between those vectors using euclidean metric books on.  I'm going to come back then, but you can see the two snakes nicely are reasonably close to each other.  Where is the dart? Frog is a fair distance away from that.  Nice, right, that's a nice separation.  It says there's a difference between these two okay now.  I throw in the alligator. Sounds like a Dungeon's \u0026.  Dragons game, I throw in the alligator and I want to do the same comparison, and I don't get nearly as nice as a result because now, it says, as before the two snakes are close to each other, but it says that the dart frog in the alligator are much closer under this measurement than either of them is to the other and to remind you write the alligator and the two snakes.  I would like to be close to one another and a distance away from the Frog. Because I'm trying to classify reptiles versus not. So what happened to you well?  This is a place where the feature engineering is going to be important, because in fact, the alligator differs from the frog in 3 features but and only into features from say the boa constrictor. But one of those features is the number of legs and there while on the binary axies the differences between a 01 here.  I can between can be between 0 and 4 so that is weighing the distance a lot more than we would like the legs.  Dimension is too large. If you like, how would I fix this?  This is actually, I would argue a natural place to use Manhattan distance.
