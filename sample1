It was easy we knew for job was going to be a linear model.  We found the best of line that would fit that date.  In some cases, we said we could use validation to actually let us explore to find the best model. It would fit it.  Whether it's a linear, a cubic yard of linear quadratic and cubic some higher order thing to do something about a model, That's a nice Segway into the topic for the next three lectures, the last big topic of the class, which is machine learning debate whether that's actually an example of learning, but it has many of the elements that we want to talk.","confidence":0.94,"words":[{"start":0.0,"end":0.2,"word":"the","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":0.2,"end":0.6000000000000001,"word":"idea","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":0.6000000000000001,"end":0.8,"word":"of","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":0.8,"end":1.6,"word":"a","confidence":0.8248928785324097,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":1.6,"end":1.9,"word":"have","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":1.9,"end":2.0,"word":"some","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":2.0,"end":2.8,"word":"experimental","confidence":0.9184169173240662,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":2.8,"end":2.9,"word":"data","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":2.9,"end":3.9,"word":"case","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":3.9,"end":4.2,"word":"of","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":4.2,"end":4.3,"word":"a","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":4.3,"end":4.7,"word":"spring","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":4.7,"end":4.8,"word":"where","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":4.8,"end":4.9,"word":"I","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":4.9,"end":5.1,"word":"put","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":5.1,"end":5.3,"word":"different","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":5.3,"end":5.7,"word":"weights","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":5.7,"end":5.8,"word":"on","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":5.8,"end":5.9,"word":"a","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":5.9,"end":6.4,"word":"measure","confidence":0.9862003326416016,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":6.4,"end":6.6,"word":"displacement","confidence":0.9697256088256836,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":6.6,"end":7.8,"word":"and","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":7.8,"end":8.3,"word":"regression","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":8.3,"end":8.5,"word":"was","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":8.5,"end":8.9,"word":"giving","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":8.9,"end":9.0,"word":"us","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":9.0,"end":9.1,"word":"a","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":9.1,"end":9.4,"word":"way","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":9.4,"end":9.7,"word":"of","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":9.7,"end":10.3,"word":"deducing","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":10.3,"end":10.5,"word":"a","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":10.5,"end":11.0,"word":"model","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":12.7,"end":13.0,"word":"Data","confidence":0.9771003127098083,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":13.0,"end":14.0,"word":"in","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":14.0,"end":14.3,"word":"some","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":14.3,"end":14.6,"word":"cases","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":14.6,"end":14.8,"word":"it","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":14.8,"end":15.0,"word":"was","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":15.0,"end":15.3,"word":"easy","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":15.3,"end":15.4,"word":"we","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":15.4,"end":15.6,"word":"knew","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":15.6,"end":15.8,"word":"for","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":15.8,"end":16.1,"word":"job","confidence":0.60411137342453,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":16.1,"end":16.4,"word":"was","confidence":0.5402977466583252,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":16.4,"end":16.4,"word":"going","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":16.4,"end":16.5,"word":"to","confidence":0.6073794364929199,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":16.5,"end":16.6,"word":"be","confidence":0.8066930770874023,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":16.6,"end":16.7,"word":"a","confidence":0.8111096620559692,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":16.7,"end":16.9,"word":"linear","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":16.9,"end":17.1,"word":"model","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":17.1,"end":17.4,"word":"we","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":17.4,"end":17.7,"word":"found","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":17.7,"end":17.8,"word":"the","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":17.8,"end":18.0,"word":"best","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":18.0,"end":18.1,"word":"of","confidence":0.9646814465522766,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":18.1,"end":18.5,"word":"line","confidence":0.9876290559768677,"speaker_id":"0"},{"start":18.5,"end"
